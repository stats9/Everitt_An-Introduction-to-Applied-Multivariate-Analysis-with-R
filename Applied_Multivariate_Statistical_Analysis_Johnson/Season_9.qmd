#### Ex. iv. 

9.4. Given $\rho$ and $\psi$ in Exercise 9.1 and an m = 1 factor model, calculate the reduced
correlation matrix $\tilde{\rho} = \rho - \psi$ and the principal factor solution for the loading matrix L.
Is the result consistent with the information in Exercise 9.1? Should it be?

###### Soloution

```{r}
#| warning: false


rho <- matrix(c(1, 0.63, 0.45, 0.63, 1, 
                .35, .45, .35, 1), 3, 3, byrow = T)
rho
psi <- diag(c(0.19, 0.51, 0.75), 3)
psi
L <- matrix(c(0.9, 0.7, 0.5), 3, 1)
ll <- L %*% t(L)

le <- eigen(rho)$values
ve <- eigen(rho)$vectors
ress <- rho - psi

all(ress - ll < 1e-10)
