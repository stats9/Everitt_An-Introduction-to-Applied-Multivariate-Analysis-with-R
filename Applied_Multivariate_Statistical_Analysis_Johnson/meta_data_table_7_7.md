Measurements of properties of pulp fibers and the paper made from them are contained 
in Table 7.7 (see also (19] and website: www.prenhall.com/statistics). There are n = 62 
observations of the pulp fiber characteristics, X1 = arithmetic fiber length, X2 = long 
fiber fraction, X3 = fine fiber fraction, X4 = zero span tensile, and the paper properties, 
YI = breaking length, Y2 = elastic modulus, y3 = stress at failure, y4 = burst strength.
